Video games have been a big part of my life since as long as I can remember. I've always been mainly a single player kinda guy, and I do love a good story. The first consoles I ever remember owning were a PS1 and an N64, both of which are quite a bit older than yours truly. I have many fond memories as a young boy of spending hours in Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Crash Team Racing, Gran Turismo 2, I could go on. I also had a PSP and a DS Lite, both of which I played the heck out of.

Some of my favourite franchises are Zelda, Pokémon, and Persona (just to name a few).

Here are some games I'm currently playing through! Though, I tend not to play very much if at all during the school term so I don't anticipate finishing these any time soon. :(
