Hello internet! Here I post information about the different projects I've worked on, my experience, and anything else that comes to mind. Check out the different sections of my site to have a look!

Currently, I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Alberta for [CMPUT 204](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/cmput/204), an algorithms course. I was a lead teaching assistant for [CMPUT 201](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/cmput/201) in the past, and co-designed the courses lab exercises surrounding C programming. Professionally, I am interested in a variety of fields including DevOps, Networking and IT Systems, and Machine Learning.

Some of my personal interests include playing around with my home server, reading, playing video games, watching anime, and more! You may see me post about them on my personal blog.
